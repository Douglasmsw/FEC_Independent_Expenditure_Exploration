# FEC_Independent_Expenditure_Exploration

This was my second project, so still a lot of messy Jupyter notebook code. My boss at the time was curious to see who the big financial players were 
gonna be in the 2022 midterm elections. I figured the FEC data portal would tell me what I needed, but the data is not formatted in a way that 
allows me to see the top ___ sources of independent expenditure in ___ state. So I downloaded the raw independent expenditure data from their portal
(which can be found here: https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/independent-expenditures-file-description/) and went to work!

The code in this notebook allowed me to put in the name of a state and get a nice pandas dataframe with the top ____ spenders, how much they've spent, 
and filter by party affiliation and/or opposition.

If I were to return to this project now, I'd do some fuzzy matching because the names are not always put in the same, but I think it's a fun little tool
that gives you a sense of who the big spenders are.
